/* more complex structures 

map contours ??
gridded backgrounds
diamond gridded backgrounds
feather arcs - from barrier
vector flows
hex pods - from barrier
line edges, swipe edges
cross hatching fields 
really wish I could get a landscape in somehow ??
radial lines - maybe a line sequence along a path ?
line sequences | | | | 
linear auto-rigging 
dot fields ( each dot can be scalable )
hex fields ( each hex can be scalable )
sphere shells
particle flows ? (next layer up from digram?)
repeated chevrons 
identi glyphs !!!
recursive squares
